excerpt: 'Agencies, boards, and commissions (ABCs) in Canada are an extension of the executive and administrative state, yet they have a distinct character and set of governance dynamics compared to the conventional public service. ABCs are often conceived to deliver a particular service or regulate or adjudicate matters with some distance from the government of the day, yet (perhaps counter-intuitively) are among the few remaining sites of patronage-like appointments in Canada. This article compiles ABC appointment data (N = 2,248) from the Province of Alberta over two distinct periods—the Notley government (2015-2019) and the Kenney/Smith governments (2019-2024)—to explore the extent and patterns of politicization. We find mixed evidence that appointments to ABCs with more formal autonomy are more likely to be politicized, but more robust evidence that the conservative party appointees tend to be more often politically-connected, particularly in ABCs that reside in policy areas of priority for the appointing government, and in particular in crown corporations and regulatory agencies.'
